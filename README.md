Dear reader,

I am excited to share one of my earliest programming projects with you. When I embarked on this journey of learning programming, I poured my time and dedication into this project, which holds a special place in my heart. While the code quality may not be the best, the effort and genuine care invested in it are undeniable.

As of 17/05/2023, I have made the decision to release this project as an open-source endeavor. My aim is to invite the community to contribute and enhance it further, making it a collaborative effort that benefits everyone.

I truly believe that by opening up this project, we can collectively improve and refine it.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to witnessing the growth and evolution of this project together.

The GFGG is about to undergo some great code quality improvements as it will follow the OOP structure I'm using for STLGears.com . To understand what will be changed I've added the UML diagram bellow so you can get an idea of the stuff that's to come:
